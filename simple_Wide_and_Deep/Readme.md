#### **Project Description**

This project implements a **Wide & Deep Learning Model** using **PyTorch** and supports both wide (memorization) and deep (generalization) components. This architecture is particularly useful in recommendation systems, where the model needs to handle both cross-product feature transformations (wide) and automatically extract high-level features from raw inputs (deep).

The wide component is designed to handle manually engineered cross-product feature transformations, while the deep component is designed to learn implicit interactions between features using dense embeddings and fully connected layers.
